A simple perl script that will download the list of places a
particular user has checked in at with BrightKite.com and convert
it to a .GPX file. HINT: you can use GPSBabel to convert a .GPX
file to various formats for use with GPS devices or Google Earth.

Version 1.1 adds a simple database to cache entries, so subsequent
calls can add new entries and have a complete history of old entries
(even when they're no longer in the GEO-RSS feed). To reset the
database, remove ~/.bkhistory.db.

Version 1.1.1 changes the database to be named
~/.bkhistory.username.db so you can track multiple users.
